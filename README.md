# Redux quiz group project

This weeks project was about a quiz game with redux. The accomplishment of this was with MOB programming and smaller pairs. 5 questions and answers was in the requirment and in the end the summary of it. We first planned the project with kanban board using Trello and the design with the help of figma. 

## The problem

The main issues we had is of working with the branches and the errors that accured, but in the end we managed to solve them by either accept the changes or remove some code snippets. If we had more tim, we would apply some better styling and apply the correct answers in the summary section. We would also apply a startpage using react-route and maybe some sound effects.
